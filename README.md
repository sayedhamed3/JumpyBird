App Name: Jumpy Bird
Description: It is a game about a bird trying to go through pipes. As the player, you should make sure to get throught the pipes to gain points. The speed of the game increases as the game goes on.

Next Steps:
  For the future of my app instead of having the bird and pipes be made up of blocks I want to use images. I also want to make the bird rotated based on if it is jumping or falling down.
